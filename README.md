# E-commerce Shop Application

This is a simple e-commerce application built with React that fetches product data from the Fake Store API.

## Features

- Product listing with categories
- Product filtering by category
- Shopping cart functionality
- Responsive design
- Loading indicators when fetching data

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version 14.0.0 or later)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd ecommerce-app
```
3. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

## Running the Application

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm start
```

This runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Project Structure

- `/src/components` - Contains all React components
- `/src/styles` - Contains SCSS styles
- `/src/data` - Contains static data (although the app now fetches data from an API)

## API Integration

This project uses [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to fetch product data. The products are loaded when the application starts.

## Building for Production

```
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
